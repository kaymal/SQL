## Introduction
```{r connect}
# Install the package in R
#install.packages("RPostgreSQL")
library(RPostgreSQL)
## Loading required package: DBI
pgdrv <- dbDriver(drvName = "PostgreSQL")

con <-DBI::dbConnect(pgdrv,
                    dbname="template1",
                    host="localhost", port=5432,
                    user = rstudioapi::askForPassword("Database username"),
                    password = rstudioapi::askForPassword("Database password"))

```

## INNER JOIN

```{sql, connection=con}
SELECT * 
FROM cities
```
```{sql, connection=con, max.print = 5}
SELECT COUNT(*) 
FROM cities
```
```{sql, connection=con}
SELECT * 
FROM countries
```

```{sql, connection=con}
SELECT cities.name AS city, countries.name AS country, countries.region 
FROM cities
  -- Inner join to countries
  INNER JOIN countries
    -- Match on the country codes
    ON cities.country_code = countries.code;
```

Get data from both the countries and economies tables to examine the inflation rate for both 2010 and 2015.

```{sql, connection=con, max.print = 5}
-- Select fields with aliases
SELECT c.code AS country_code, c.name, year, inflation_rate
FROM countries AS c
  -- Join to economies (alias e)
  INNER JOIN economies AS e
    -- Match on code
    ON c.code = e.code;
```

Get the country name, its region, and the fertility rate for both 2010 and 2015 for each country.

```{sql, connection=con, max.print = 5}
-- Select fields
SELECT c.code, c.name, c.region, p.year, fertility_rate
  -- 1. From countries (alias as c)
  FROM countries AS c
  -- 2. Join with populations (as p)
  INNER JOIN populations AS p
    -- 3. Match on country code
    ON c.code = p.country_code
```

```{sql, connection=con, max.print = 5}
-- Select fields
SELECT c.code, name, region, e.year, fertility_rate, unemployment_rate
  -- From countries (alias as c)
  FROM countries AS c
  -- Join to populations (as p)
  INNER JOIN populations AS p
    -- Match on country code
    ON c.code = p.country_code
  -- Join to economies (as e)
  INNER JOIN economies AS e
    -- Match on country code and year
    ON c.code = e.code AND e.year = p.year;
```

### USING

```{sql, connection=con, max.print = 5}
SELECT c.name AS country, continent, l.name AS language, official
  -- From countries (alias as c)
  FROM countries AS c
  -- Join to languages (as l)
  INNER JOIN languages AS l
    -- Match using code
    USING(code)
```

### Self-Join

Use the populations table to perform a self-join to calculate the percentage increase in population from 2010 to 2015 for each country code:
```{sql, connection=con, max.print = 5}
SELECT p1.country_code,
       p1.size AS size2010, 
       p2.size AS size2015,
       -- calculate growth_perc
       ((p2.size - p1.size)/p1.size * 100.0) AS growth_perc
-- From populations (alias as p1)
FROM populations AS p1
  -- Join to itself (alias as p2)
  INNER JOIN populations AS p2
    -- Match on country code
    ON p1.country_code = p2.country_code
        -- and year (with calculation)
        AND p1.year = p2.year - 5
```
### CASE, WHEN, THEN, ELSE, and END

Create a new field _geosize_group_ that groups the countries into three groups: large, medium and small.
```{sql, connection=con, max.print = 5}
SELECT name, continent, code, surface_area,
    -- First case
    CASE WHEN surface_area > 2000000 THEN 'large'
        -- Second case
        WHEN surface_area > 350000 THEN 'medium'
        -- Else clause + end
        ELSE 'small' END
        -- Alias name
        AS geosize_group
-- From table
FROM countries;
```
### INTO
Create _countries plus_ table:
```{sql, connection=con, max.print = 5}
/*
SELECT name, continent, code, surface_area,
    CASE WHEN surface_area > 2000000
            THEN 'large'
       WHEN surface_area > 350000
            THEN 'medium'
       ELSE 'small' END
       AS geosize_group
INTO countries_plus
FROM countries;
*/
```

Explore the relationship between the size of a country in terms of surface area and in terms of population using grouping fields created with CASE:

```{sql, connection=con, max.print = 5}
/*
SELECT country_code, size,
  CASE WHEN size > 50000000
            THEN 'large'
       WHEN size > 1000000
            THEN 'medium'
       ELSE 'small' END
       AS popsize_group
INTO pop_plus       
FROM populations
WHERE year = 2015;
*/

-- Select fields
SELECT name, continent, geosize_group, popsize_group
-- From countries_plus (alias as c)
FROM countries_plus AS c
  -- Join to pop_plus (alias as p)
  INNER JOIN pop_plus AS p
    -- Match on country code
    ON c.code = p.country_code
-- Order the table    
ORDER BY geosize_group;
```

## Outer JOIN
```{sql, connection=con, max.print = 5}

```

## Set Theory
```{sql, connection=con, max.print = 5}

```

## Subqueries
```{sql, connection=con, max.print = 5}

```
